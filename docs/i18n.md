# i18n

SveltePress supports i18n natively. Content can be optionally keyed by language code, and will
automatically load the correct content for the user's locale.

To enable localization, pass the language codes you want to support to the Admin Bar:

`routes/+layout.svelte`

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { AdminBar } from "sveltepress";
</script>

<AdminBar languages={['en-US', 'es-ES']} />

<slot />
```

This will add a language dropdown to the Admin Bar. To create a new version of the page
in a different language, switch the language, edit the content and click Save.
