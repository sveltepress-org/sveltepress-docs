# Long-term Sustainability

A primary goal of the SveltePress project is to be around for a long time.
There's a few operating principals driving this goal:

### 1. Not raising (much) money

SveltePress has a narrow scope of being the best content platform for Svelte.
No lofty goal of raising millions to change the world. Raising money often sets up
a binary outcome of performing fantastically or crashing and burning. SveltePress
runs just fine on the (novel) concept of selling services for an amount greater than the costs.

### 2. Balancing free and paid tiers

As developers, we love a good free offering. It gives us the freedom to run side projects
without worrying about the cost. On the flip-side, for SveltePress to run sustainably,
the paid offering must cover the paid _and_ free offering costs. We're starting with a conservative
free tier. As the project grows, SveltePress will evaluate this balance and expand
the free tier when possible.

### 3. Transparency on profitability

We're taking a unique approach to [#buildinpublic](https://twitter.com/hashtag/buildinpublic) and transparency. We're making the internal dashboard public with a graph of free and paid instances, the costs, the profit margin and the timeline to
reach profitability. The goal is to build trust in a platform that will run sustainably in to the future.

### 4. Open source

SveltePress is open source, MIT-licensed and built with other MIT-licensed software. In the event of unexpectedly needing to shut down the platform, there is a clear migration path to self-hosting on another service. In this scenario, we'd make a best effort to open source the infrastructure layer too.
